## [About](#about)

* WinGTP is a free, cross-platform, full-featured and fully functional GUI implementation of the OpenAI API built purely with Python. 

* Chat, files, audio transcription, image edits, image variations, new images, translations, embeddings, fine-tuning, moderations, sentement analysis, q&a, summarization and code generation are all available and easy to use. 

* You can switch between all available engines using a simple drop down menu and you can also easily control all available parameters such as: temperature, max tokens, response count, best of, frequency & presence penalty, timeout etc. from a modern gui to easily adjust responses.

* Use user defined data files, and jsonl data files. 

* View and change other settings like api_type, api_base and api_version.  

* Your api key is stored so you only need to enter it once during setup and it will persist and be automatically loaded on next startup. If you generate a new key you can easily switch and store the new one. 

* Organization settings are also available to control which organization is used by default when making requests with your API keys       

* Light, Dark & System themes available as well as color settings and ui scaling.

* This is just version 1 of many updates to come still so the gui will improve vastly in the very near future. I'm a one man show and really wanted to focus on functionality and wrapping 
the gui around the openai. I wanted to create a 1|1 wrapper around the api and I think WinGTP accomplishes that.

### Reporting a vulnerability or bug?

**Do not submit an issue or pull request**: A general rule of thumb is to never publicly report bugs or vulnerabilities because you might inadvertently reveal it to unethical people who may use it for bad. Instead, you can email me directly at: [paulmccarthy676@gmail.com](mailto:paulmccarthy676@gmail.com). I will deal with the issue privately and submit a patch as soon as possible.
